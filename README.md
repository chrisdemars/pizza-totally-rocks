# Pizza Recipe App

This app is a project I have gone through with the help of a tutorial to call a recipe API and returns the results, the only difference between this one and that one is that this one just returns 🍕.

## Why 🍕?

Because everyone ❤️'s 🍕...I hope!!!!

### Contributing 🍕!

Everything is available in the repo, except the API id and key. If you need these, check out https://developer.edamam.com and sign up to grab one from the Recipe Search API.

Put the API keys in a new .env file in the root folder using the .env.sample as an example.

Submit an issue then fork > clone > fix > submit PR.

Thanks!
